# MicroBench

Ideas: Multiple Kernels with different computational complexities.

1. Element Wise Addition (compute per bytes low)
2. Matrix Mutliplication
3. [Convolution]

Access Patterns

1. Sequential Forward and Back
2. Sequential Forward and back leaving a wake of dirty data.
3. LFSR full walk random.
4. Full sudo-random.
